# Project Overview:

I aim to predict which loans are most likely to default so that financial institutions can make better-informed lending decisions. This project demonstrates my ability to solve a meaningful business problem by leveraging real-world data, advanced predictive models, and interactive deployment—all while showcasing my SQL expertise. I focus on end-to-end work that covers data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, interpretation, and interactive application development.

# Defining the Problem and Business Objectives

For my project, I’ve defined the core problem as predicting loan default risk and assessing credit risk in a way that empowers financial institutions to make better-informed lending decisions. More specifically, the problem centers on identifying high-risk borrowers early on, so that proactive measures can be taken to mitigate potential losses.

# Problem Definition

I want to address the following challenges:

*Default Prediction*: Loans that default can significantly impact a financial institution’s bottom line. I aim to build a model that accurately predicts which loans are at high risk of default by analyzing historical data, borrower behavior, and financial indicators.

*Credit Risk Management*: Beyond individual loans, I need to provide actionable insights into credit risk across the loan portfolio. This means understanding trends and patterns in borrower performance, financial health, and economic indicators to help refine risk strategies.

*Data Integration and Quality*: In the real world, data comes from multiple sources and can be messy. Part of the challenge is to clean, aggregate, and transform this data using robust SQL methodologies, ensuring that the subsequent analyses and predictive models are built on a solid, reliable foundation.

# Business Objectives

The business objectives for my project are:

*Reduce Financial Losses*:

Objective: Minimize the financial losses incurred due to loan defaults.

Measurement: Aim for a measurable reduction in default rates and improved recovery rates on high-risk loans by optimizing credit risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

*Improve Risk-Based Decision Making*:

Objective: Enable more informed lending decisions based on a rigorous, data-driven risk profile of each borrower.

Measurement: Increase the accuracy of risk predictions (using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, recall) so that credit officers can better balance the need for growth with risk avoidance.

*Enhance Operational Efficiency*:

Objective: Streamline data ingestion, cleaning, and analysis by integrating SQL workflows with the machine learning pipeline.

Measurement: Reduce the turnaround time for risk assessments and ensure that insights are updated in near real-time through automated processes.

*Ensure Regulatory Compliance and Business Transparency*:

Objective: Support a transparent and auditable risk assessment process that meets regulatory standards.

Measurement: Maintain comprehensive documentation and interactive dashboards that show the rationale behind risk scores and model predictions, facilitating regulatory reviews and internal audits.

*Drive Strategic Business Impact*:

Objective: Provide actionable insights that drive strategic decision making, such as identifying market segments with emerging risk trends and opportunities for product customization.

Measurement: Use predictive insights to advise strategic initiatives, potentially improving overall portfolio quality and customer segmentation strategies.
